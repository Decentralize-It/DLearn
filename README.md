# DLearn
Decentralized Learning on the Steem blockchain, where content creators and curators are incentivized

## Our Mission
DLearn aims to change the world through education by creating a platform in which educators are incentivized to teach at no cost to the student in order to remove barriers to upward mobility by making quality education accessible to everyone.

## Our Vision
We believe that education is the key to solving many of the worlds problems, specifically the uneven distribution of wealth, which is perpetuated for generations because the quality of the instruction that a student recieves is relative to their location and their ability to afford a superior education. The BLS (Bureau of Labor Statistics (US)) [report](https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat07.pdf) on employent status by level of education.
